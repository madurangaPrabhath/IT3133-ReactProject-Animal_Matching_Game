# Animal Matching Game 🦁 (Assignment 4)

## Overview 🌟

The **Animal Matching Game** is a fun and educational game designed for children to enhance their object recognition and language abilities. The game displays an animal name on the left side of the page, and the player needs to select the correct animal image from a grid of 16 animals. If the player chooses the correct animal, they win; otherwise, they lose. This simple game helps improve both recognition skills and language development in an engaging way.
